Overwrites vanilla Political Movement definitions with scripted triggers to aid in mod compatibility

Add dummy ideologies from mods into political movements, allowing them to spawn with the appropiate mod enabled:
* Add a dummy ideology with the same name as your mod ideology
* Assign the ideology to the appropiate political movements (and scripted triggers if needed)
* Load this mod below any other mod
* Your mod will overwrite the ideology definition and allow it to spawn in the specified political movements
